# CalculatorApp

Welcome to my Calculator App! This is a .NET console application that will allow you to perform simple arithmetic operations. 

The Calculator application has been created with the following requirements:

1. Calculator should be able to do Add, Subtract and Multiply.
2. Create an abstract base class called CalculatorBase, which contains Add, Subtract and Multiply function. All 3 function takes EXACTLY 2 interger arguments as input.
3. Inherit the Abstract base class with a class called Calculator, which overrides Add, Subtract and Multiply function from base class.
